   # For specific client
   CLIENT=reth docker compose up --build
   ```

## üêõ Bug Reports

* **Ensure your issue has not already been reported**. It may already be fixed!
* Include the steps you carried out to produce the problem.
* Include the behavior you observed along with the behavior you expected, and why you expected it.
* Include any relevant stack traces or debugging output.

### Helpful Information to Include

#### Environment Details
- **OS and version** (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 13.0)
- **Docker version** (run `docker --version`)
- **Node version** (from releases - which version are you running?)
- **Network** (mainnet/sepolia)
- **Client** (geth/reth/nethermind)

#### Logs and Configuration
```bash
# Include relevant logs
docker compose logs node
docker compose logs geth
# or for reth
docker compose logs reth
```

- Relevant parts of your `.env` file (**redact sensitive info like API keys**)
- Hardware specifications (CPU, RAM, storage)
- Any custom modifications made

**Before submitting:**
- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/base/node/issues) to avoid duplicates
- Check [Discord #üõ†ÔΩúnode-operators](https://discord.gg/buildonbase) for known issues
- Review the [documentation](https://docs.base.org/) for potential solutions

## üí° Feature Requests

We welcome feedback with or without pull requests. If you have an idea for how to improve the project, great! All we ask is that you take the time to write a clear and concise explanation of what need you are trying to solve. If you have thoughts on how it can be solved, include those too!

The best way to see a feature added, however, is to submit a pull request.

### When Proposing Enhancements

1. **Check existing issues** for similar proposals to avoid duplicates
2. **Provide clear use case** - explain why this would be useful to Base node operators
3. **Include examples** of how it would be used
4. **Consider implementation** - share any ideas about potential challenges or approaches

**Remember:** Not all suggestions will be implemented. Maintainers prioritize features based on:
- Alignment with project goals
- Community benefit
- Development resources
- Technical feasibility

## üì¨ Pull Request Process

* Before creating your pull request, it's usually worth asking if the code you're planning on writing will actually be considered for merging. You can do this by **opening an issue** and asking. It may also help give the maintainers context for when the time comes to review your code.

* Ensure your **commit messages are well-written**. This can double as your pull request message, so it pays to take the time to write a clear message.

* Add tests for your feature. You should be able to look at other tests for examples. If you're unsure, don't hesitate to **open an issue** and ask!

* Submit your pull request!

### Detailed PR Guidelines

1. **Ensure your changes are meaningful**
   - One logical change per PR
   - Address a specific issue or add a specific feature
   - Include only related changes

2. **Update documentation** if your changes affect usage
   - Update README.md if needed
   - Add comments to code for clarity
   - Update configuration examples

3. **Test thoroughly**
   - Test with different configurations
   - Verify your changes work as intended
   - Check for edge cases

4. **Fill in the PR template** with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Link to related issues (if any)
   - Testing performed and results
   - Screenshots (if UI changes)
   - Breaking changes (if any)

5. **Respond to feedback**
   - Address review comments promptly
   - Update your PR as requested
   - Be patient and respectful
   - Ask questions if unclear

## üìù Commit Message Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for clear and organized git history:

### Format
```
<type>: <short summary>

<optional body>

<optional footer>
```

### Types
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `ci:` - CI/CD changes

### Example
```
docs: add FAQ section for common L1 beacon issues

- Added troubleshooting for OP_NODE_L1_BEACON errors
- Included examples for different beacon clients (Lighthouse, Prysm, Teku)
- Added links to relevant documentation

Fixes #255
```

### Best Practices
- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Keep the summary line under 72 characters
- Reference issues and PRs in the footer
- Explain **what** and **why**, not **how**

## üîç Review Process & Timeline

### What to Expect

- **Initial Acknowledgment:** A maintainer will acknowledge your PR within **3-5 business days**
- **Detailed Review:** Full review typically completed within **7-10 days**

- Be patient - maintainers may be handling multiple PRs

**Note:** PRs require at least one approval from a core maintainer before merging. Complex changes may require additional reviewers or discussion.

## üß™ Testing

Add tests for your feature. You should be able to look at other tests for examples. If you're unsure, don't hesitate to open an issue and ask!

### Running Tests
